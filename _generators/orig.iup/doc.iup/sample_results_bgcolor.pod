=head1 Sample Results (3)

The following screenshots shows the L<sample.c|../examples/C/sample.c>
results when the dialog L<BGCOLOR|attrib/iup_bgcolor.html> attribute is
changed. See also the same sample with L<normal
background|sample_results.html>, changing the L<dialog
BACKGROUND|sample_results_background.html> and the L<children
BGCOLOR|sample_results_bgcolor_indiv.html>.

Since BGCOLOR is an inheritable attribute changing it at the dialog
affects all controls. And notice that on Windows the BGCOLOR is ignored
for several controls.
