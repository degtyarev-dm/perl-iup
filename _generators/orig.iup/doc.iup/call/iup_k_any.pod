=head1 K_ANY

Action generated when a keyboard event occurs.

=head2 Callback

 int function(Ihandle *ih, int c); [in C]
 elem:k_any(c: number) -> (ret: number) [in Lua]

B<ih>: identifier of the element that activated the event.

B<c>: identifier of typed key. Please refer to the L<Keyboard
Codes|../attrib/key.html> table for a list of possible values.

Returns: If IUP_IGNORE is returned the key is ignored and not processed
by the control and not propagated. If returns IUP_CONTINUE, the key
will be processed and the event will be propagated to the parent of the
element receiving it, this is the default behavior. If returns
IUP_DEFAULT the key is processed but it is not propagated. IUP_CLOSE
will be processed.

=head2 Notes

Keyboard callbacks depend on the keyboard usage of the control with the
focus. So if you return IUP_IGNORE the control will usually not process
the key. But be aware that sometimes the control process the key in
another event so even returning IUP_IGNORE the key can get processed.
Although it will not be propagated.

IMPORTANT: The callbacks "K_*" of the dialog or native containers
depend on the IUP_CONTINUE return value to work while the control is in
focus.

If the callback does not exists it is automatically propagated to the
parent of the element.

=head2 K_* callbacks

All defined keys are also callbacks of any element, called when the
respective key is activated. For example: "K_cC" is also a callback
activated when the user press Ctrl+C, when the focus is at the element
or at a children with focus. This is the way an application can create
shortcut keys, also called hot keys. These callbacks are not available
in IupLua.

=head2 Affects

All elements with keyboard interaction.
