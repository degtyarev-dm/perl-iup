=head1 WHEEL_CB

Action generated when the mouse wheel is rotated. If this callback is
not defined the wheel will automatically scroll the canvas in the
vertical direction by some lines, the SCROLL_CB callback if defined
will be called with the IUP_SBDRAGV operation.

=head2 Callback

 int function(Ihandle *ih, float delta, int x, int y, char *status); [in C]
 elem:wheel_cb(delta, x, y: number, status: string) -> (ret: number) [in Lua]

B<ih>: identifier of the element that activated the event.

B<delta>: the amount the wheel was rotated in notches.

B<x>, B<y>: position in the canvas where the event has occurred, in
pixels.

B<status>: status of mouse buttons and certain keyboard keys at the
moment the event was generated. The same macros used for
L<BUTTON_CB|../call/iup_button_cb.html> can be used for this status.

=head2 Notes

In Motif and GTK delta is always 1 or -1. In Windows is some situations
delta can reach the value of two. In the future with more precise
wheels this increment can be changed.

The wheel will only work if the focus is at the canvas.
