=head2 Creation and Show

=over

 int IupGetFile(char *filename); [in C]
 iup.GetFile(filename: string) -> (filename: string, status: number) [in Lua]

=back

B<filename>: This parameter is used as an input value to define the
default filter and directory. Example: "../docs/*.txt". As an output
value, it is used to contain the filename entered by the user.

Returns: a B<status> code, whose values can be:

=over

"1": New file.

"0": Normal, existing file.

"-1": Operation cancelled.

=back

=head2 Notes

The function does not allocate memory space to store the complete
filename entered by the user. Therefore, the filename parameter must be
large enough to contain the directory and file names. The string is
limited to 4096 characters.

The function will reuse the directory from one call to another, so in
the next call will open in the directory of the last selected file.

The dialog uses a global attribute called "PARENTDIALOG" as the parent
dialog if it is defined. It also uses a global attribute called "ICON"
as the dialog icon if it is defined.
