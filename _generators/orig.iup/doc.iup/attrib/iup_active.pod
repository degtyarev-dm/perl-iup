=head1 ACTIVE

Activates or inhibits user interaction.

=head2 Value

"YES" (active), "NO" (inactive).

Default: "YES"

=head2 Notes

An interface element is only active if its native parent is also
active.

ACTIVE can also be set for controls that do not have user interaction
because they may have a visual feedback to indicate the inactive state.

In GTK and Motif the inactive dialogs will still be able to move,
resize and change their Z-order. Although their contents will be
inactive, keyboard will be disabled, and they can not be closed from
the close box.

=head2 Affects

All controls that have visual representation.
