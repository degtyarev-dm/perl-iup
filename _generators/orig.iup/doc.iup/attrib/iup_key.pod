=head1 KEY

Associates a key to a menu item or submenu. Such key works as a
shortcut when the menu is open, this is not a hot key.

=head2 Value

String containing a key description. Its is a string representation of
an IUP key code. Please refer to the L<Keyboard Codes|key.html> table
for a list of the possible values.

Default: NULL

=head2 Notes

IUP automatically underlines the first appearance of the chosen menu
letter. For such, the chosen letter must necessarily be a part of the
menu text.

In Windows, when used will also set an underscore on the respective
letter of the submenu title.

The key will be used when navigating in the parent menu that contains
the item. If the same character key is present in the title, then it
will be underlined.

In the menu bar, some systems automatically associate the
ALT+E<lt>letterE<gt> combination for the chosen letter. This is valid
for the Windows driver, but not for the Motif driver.

Be careful not to misuse this attribute in relation to
L<K_ANY|../call/iup_k_any.html> or K_* callbacks.

=head2 Affects
