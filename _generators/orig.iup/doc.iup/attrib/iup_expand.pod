=head1 EXPAND (non inheritable)

Allows the element to expand, fulfilling empty spaces inside its
container.

It is a non inheritable attribute, but a container can inherits its
parents EXPAND attribute. So although EXPAND is non inheritable, it is
inheritable for containers. So if you set it at a container it will not
affect its children, but a child that is a container will get the same
value if not defined at the child itself.

The expansion is done equally for all expandable elements in the same
container.

See the L<Layout Guide|../layout_guide.html> for more details on sizes.

=head2 Value

"YES" (both directions), "HORIZONTAL", "VERTICAL" or "NO".

Default: "NO". For containers the default is "YES".

=head2 Affects

All elements, except menus.
