=head1 CLIENTOFFSET (read-only) (non inheritable) (since 3.3)

Returns the container offset to the B<Client> area, see the L<Layout
Guide|../layout_guide.html>. Useful for B<IupFrame>, B<IupTabs> and
B<IupDialog> that have decorations. Can also be consulted in other
containers, it will return "0x0". For controls that have a native
representation is only available when the control is mapped.

In GTK and Motif, for the B<IupDialog>, the dy value is negative when
there is a menu. This occours because in those systems the menu is
placed inside the Client Area and all children must be placed below the
menu.

In Windows, for the B<IupFrame>, the value is always "0x0" because it
actually does not have a B<Client> area, so the child is manually
positioned in the expected B<Client> area.

This attribute can be used in conjunction with the POSITION attribute
of a child so the coordinates of a child relative to the native parent
top-left corner can be obtained.

=head2 Value

"I<dx>xI<dy>", where I<dx> and I<dy> are integer values corresponding
to the horizontal and vertical offsets, respectively, in pixels.

=head2 Affects

All elements that are containers, except menus.
