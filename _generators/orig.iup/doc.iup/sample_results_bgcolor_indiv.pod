=head1 Sample Results (4)

The following screenshots shows the L<sample.c|../examples/C/sample.c>
results when the L<BGCOLOR|attrib/iup_bgcolor.html> attribute of the
dialog children is changed, but NOT the dialog. See also the same
sample with L<normal background|sample_results.html>, changing the
L<dialog BACKGROUND|sample_results_background.html> and the L<dialog
BGCOLOR|sample_results_bgcolor.html>.

In this case, the BGCOLOR attribute affects only the controls. Also
notice that the transparent area of the controls are not affected. And
notice that on Windows the BGCOLOR is ignored for several controls.
