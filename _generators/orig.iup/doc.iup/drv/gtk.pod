=head1 GTK System Driver (since 3.0)

This driver was designed for the GTK+ version 2. It can be compiled in
Windows or UNIX.

Although GTK has layout elements they are not used. IUP fill, vbox,
hbox and zbox containers are implemented independent from the native
system.

The oldest GTK version that can be used is 2.4, oldest versions will
not compile. But using versions older than 2.12 several features will
not work. Critical features need at least version 2.8.

Currently it is not available for IRIX, AIX and SunOS. But is it
available for SunOS10 and it is not available for Linux24.

=head2 Tips

=head2 Dependencies

GTK is in fact composed of several libraries. The GTK package contains
the GDK library and depends on the ATK, Cairo, Glib and Pango
libraries.

=head2 UTF-8

GTK uses UTF-8 as its charset for all displayed text, so IUP will
automatically convert all strings to (SetAttribute) and from
(GetAttribute) UTF-8. To use UTF-8 strings set the global attribute
UTF8AUTOCONVERT to NO.

=head2 Windows

The GTK driver can be compiled and used in Windows, but it is not
recommended since it is slower and much more memory consuming than the
IUP native Windows driver.

When using DLLs in Windows, the "iup.dll" uses the Win32 driver. So
applications that dynamically load IUP will always use the "iup.dll",
for example Lua using require. To use the IUP GTK dll in Windows you
must rename the "iupgtk.dll" to "iup.dll", so the GTK driver will be
loaded instead of the Win32 driver.

After installing the GTK binaries, we recommend to change the default
theme to the "MS-Windows" theme. Edit the "gtk\etc\gtk-2.0\gtkrc" file
and change its contents to:

 gtk-theme-name = "MS-Windows"

=head2 MacOSX

The GTK driver also compiles in MacOSX with the new GTK port available
at
L<http:E<47>E<47>gtk-osx.sourceforge.netE<47>|http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net/>.
But the B<IupGLCanvas> is not available yet. You must use the GDK base
driver of the CD library. Some elements like B<IupTree> are not 100%
functional because of the gtk-osx implementation. The installation of
gtk-osx is quite complex because there are no pre-compiled binaries.
Also if the MacOSX theme is used, several controls have problems. We
hope that this will improve in the future. Must define GTK_MAC in the
config.mak makefile to enable this build.

So for now we are distributing binaries that use the X11 version of GTK
2.16. They were installed using L<Fink|http://www.finkproject.org/>.
Here is a simple guide to install fink so the pre-compiled binaries
will work (tested in 10.5 and 10.6):

 Download latest fink source: fink-0.29.10
 tar -xvzf fink-0.29.10.tar.gz 
 cd fink-0.29.10
 ./bootstrap
 	Use all default answers, except for the second question about 64bits:
 	(10.5) => (1) Default (mostly 32bit)  [because gcc use 32bit as default]
 	(10.6) => (2) 64bit-only              [because gcc use 64bit as default]
 /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh
 fink install gtk+2 gtk+2-dev

It will take some time to download and install everything, so have
patience.

After that you should get something like this:

 fink --version
   Package manager version: 0.29.10
   Distribution version: selfupdate-rsync Thu Apr 29 11:51:11 2010, 10.6, x86_64  (10.6)
   Distribution version: selfupdate-rsync Thu Apr 29 11:50:49 2010, 10.5, i386    (10.5)
