=head1 Sample Results (2)

The following screenshots shows the L<sample.c|../examples/C/sample.c>
results when the dialog L<BACKGROUND|dlg/iupdialog.html#Attributes>
attribute is changed. See also the same sample with L<normal
background|sample_results.html>, the L<dialog
BGCOLOR|sample_results_bgcolor.html> and the L<children
BGCOLOR|sample_results_bgcolor_indiv.html>.

Notice that the dialog BACKGROUND attribute affects only the background
of the dialog, the background of each control is preserved except for
the ones that the background is transparent.
