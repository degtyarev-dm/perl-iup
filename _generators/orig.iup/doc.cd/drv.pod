=head1 Drivers

Driver is the implementation of functions of a canvas for a specific
canvas type. In other words it represents the context in which the
canvas is situated. For example, a Window System that has windows on
which you can draw.

It can be portable, platform independent, or it can has a different
implementation in each platform. In this case its functions may have
different behaviors, but the library is implemented in such a way that
these differences are minimized.
