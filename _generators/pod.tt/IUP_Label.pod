[% h.name %]

[% n.iuplabel %]

[% h.desc %]

Creates a label interface element, which displays a separator, a text
or an image.

[% h.usage %]

[% h.create %]

 Ihandle* IUP::Label(const char *title); [in C]
 iup.label{[title = title: string]} -> (elem: ihandle) [in Lua]
 label(title) [in LED]

B<title>: Text to be shown on the label. It can be NULL. It will set
the TITLE attribute.

[% txt.new_attr %]

B<Returns:> the identifier of the created element, or C<undef> if an error occurs.

=item * B<ACTIVE>

The only difference between an active label and an inactive
one is its visual feedback. Possible values: "YES, "NO". Default:
"YES".

=item * B<ALIGNMENT> (non inheritable)

horizontal and vertical alignment.
Possible values: "ALEFT", "ACENTER" and "ARIGHT", combined to "ATOP",
"ACENTER" and "ABOTTOM". Default: "ALEFT:ACENTER". Partial values are
also accepted, like "ARIGHT" or ":ATOP", the other value will be used
from the current alignment. In Motif, vertical alignment is restricted
to "ACENTER". (vertical alignment since 3.0)

=item * L<BGCOLOR|[%m.at%]/BGCOLOR>

ignored, transparent in all
systems. Will use the background color of the native parent.

=item * B<ELLIPSIS> [Windows and GTK only]

add an ellipsis: "..." to the text
if there is not enough space to render the entire string. Can be "YES"
or "NO". Default: "NO".  (GTK 2.6)

=item * L<FGCOLOR|[%m.at%]/FGCOLOR>

Text color. Default: the global
attribute DLGFGCOLOR.

=item * B<IMAGE> (non inheritable)

Image name. If set before map defines the
behavior of the label to contain an image. The natural size will be
size of the image in pixels. Use
=item * L<IUP::SetHandle|IUP::SetHandle> or
L<IUP::SetAttributeHandle|IUP::SetAttributeHandle> to
associate an image to a name. See also L<IUP::Image|IUP::Image>.

B<IMINACTIVE> (non inheritable) [GTK and Motif only]

Image name of the
element when inactive. If it is not defined then the IMAGE is used and
the colors will be replaced by a modified version of the background
color creating the disabled effect. GTK will also change the inactive
image to look like other inactive objects.

=item * B<MARKUP> [GTK only]

allows the title string to contains pango markup
commands. Works only if a mnemonic is NOT defined in the title. Can be
"YES" or "NO". Default: "NO".

=item * B<PADDING>

internal margin. Works just like the MARGIN attribute of
the IUP::Hbox and IUP::Vbox containers, but uses a different name to avoid
inheritance problems. Not used when SEPARATOR is used. Default value:
"0x0". 

=item * B<SEPARATOR >(creation only) (non inheritable)

Turns the label into a
line separator. Possible values: "HORIZONTAL" or "VERTICAL". When
changed before mapping the EXPAND attribute is set to "HORIZONTAL" or
"VERTICAL" accordingly.

=item * L<TITLE|[%m.at%]/TITLE> (non inheritable)

Label's text. If
SEPARATOR or IMAGE are not defined before map, then the default
behavior is to contain a text. The label behavior can not be changed
after map. The natural size will be larger enough to include all the
text in the selected font, even using multiple lines. The '\n'
character is accepted for line change. The "&" character can be used to
define a mnemonic, the next character will be used as key. Use "&&" to
show the "&" character instead of defining a mnemonic. The next control
from the label will be activated from any control in the dialog using
the "Alt+key" combination. (mnemonic support since 3.0)

=item * B<WORDWRAP> [Windows and GTK only]

enables or disable the wrapping of
lines that does not fits in the label. Can be "YES" or "NO". Default:
"NO". Can only set WORDWRAP=YES if ALIGNMENT=ALEFT.

[% h.notes %]

Labels with images, texts or line separator can not change its behavior
after mapped. But after map the image can be changed for another image,
and the text for another text.
