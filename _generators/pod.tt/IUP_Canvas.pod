=item * B<BACKINGSTORE> [Motif Only]

Controls the canvas backing store flag.
The default value is "YES".

=item * L<BGCOLOR|[%m.at%]/BGCOLOR>

Background color. The background
is painted only if the ACTION callback is not defined. If the callback
is defined the application must draw all the canvas contents. In GTK or
Motif if you set the ACTION callback after map then you should also set
BGCOLOR to any value just after setting the callback or the first
redraw will be lost. Default: "255 255 255".

=item * B<BORDER >(creation only)

Shows a border around the canvas. Default:
"YES".

=item * B<CANFOCUS> (creation only) (non inheritable)

enables the focus
traversal of the control. In Windows the canvas will respect CANFOCUS
in opposite to the other controls. Default: YES. 

=item * B<CLIPRECT> [Windows and GTK Only] (only during ACTION)

Specifies a
rectangle that has its region invalidated for painting, it could be
used for clipping. Format: "%d %d %d %d"="x1 y1 x2 y2".

the drag&drop of files. Default: NO, but if DROPFILES_CB is defined

=item * B<DRAWSIZE >(non inheritable)

The size of the drawing area in pixels.
This size is also used in the RESIZE_CB callback.

Notice that the drawing area size is not the same as RASTERSIZE. The

Minimum value of the vertical
scrollbar. Default: "0.0".

=item * L<YMAX|[%m.at%]/YMAX>

Maximum value of the vertical
scrollbar. Default: "1.0".

=item * B<LINEX>

The amount the thumb moves when an horizontal step is
performed. Default: 1/10th of DX. 

=item * B<LINEY>

The amount the thumb moves when a vertical step is performed.
Default: 1/10th of DY. 

=item * B<X<XAUTOHIDE>XAUTOHIDE>

When enabled, if DX E<gt>= XMAX-XMIN then the
horizontal scrollbar is hidden. Default: "YES". 

=item * B<X<YAUTOHIDE>YAUTOHIDE>

When enabled, if DY E<gt>= YMAX-YMIN then the
vertical scrollbar is hidden. Default: "YES".

=item * L<ACTION|[%m.cb%]/ACTION>

Action generated when the canvas
needs to be redrawn.

 int function(Ihandle *ih, float posx, float posy); [in C]elem:action(posx, posy: number) -> (ret: number) [in Lua]

=over

=item * B<ih> - identifier of the element that activated the event.

=item * B<posx> - thumb position in the horizontal scrollbar. The POSX attribute
value.

=item * B<posy> - thumb position in the vertical scrollbar. The POSY attribute
value.

=back

=item * L<BUTTON_CB|../call/iup_button_cb.html>

Action generated when any
mouse button is pressed or released.

=item * L<DROPFILES_CB|../call/iup_dropfiles_cb.html> [Windows and GTK Only]

Action generated when one or more files are dropped in the element.

=item * B<FOCUS_CB>

Called when the canvas gets or looses the focus. It is
called after the common callbacks GETFOCUS_CB and KILL_FOCUS_CB.

 int function(Ihandle *ih, int focus); [in C]elem:focus_cb(focus: number) -> (ret: number) [in Lua]

=over

=item * B<ih> - identifier of the element that activated the event.

=item * B<focus> - is non zero if the canvas is getting the focus, is zero if it
is loosing the focus.

=back

=item * L<MOTION_CB|../call/iup_motion_cb.html>

Action generated when the
mouse is moved.

=item * L<KEYPRESS_CB|../call/iup_keypress_cb.html>

Action generated when a
key is pressed or released. It is called after the common callback
K_ANY.

When the canvas has the focus, pressing the arrow keys may change the
focus to another control in some systems. If your callback process the
arrow keys, we recommend you to return IUP_IGNORE so it will not lose
its focus.

=item * L<RESIZE_CB|../call/iup_resize_cb.html>

Action generated when the
canvas size is changed.

=item * L<SCROLL_CB|../call/iup_scroll_cb.html>

Called when the scrollbar is
manipulated. (GTK 2.8) Also the POSX and POSY values will not be
correctly updated for older GTK versions.

=item * B<TOUCH_CB> [Windows 7 Only]

Action generated when a touch event
occurred. Multiple touch events will trigger several calls. Must set
TOUCH=Yes to receive this event. (Since 3.3)

 int function(Ihandle* ih, int id, int x, int y, char* state); [in C]
 elem:touch_cb(id, x, y: number, state: string) -> (ret: number) [in Lua]

=over

=item * B<ih> - identifies the element that activated the event.

=item * B<id> - identifies the touch point.

=item * B<x>, B<y>: position in pixels, relative to the top-left corner of the
canvas.

=item * B<state> - the touch point state. Can be: DOWN, MOVE or UP. If the point
is a "primary" point then "-PRIMARY" is appended to the string.

=back

=item * B<MULTITOUCH_CB> [Windows 7 Only]

Action generated when multiple touch
events occurred. Must set TOUCH=Yes to receive this event. (Since 3.3)

top-left corner of the canvas.

[% h.notes %]

Note that some keys might remove the focus from the canvas. To avoid
this, return IGNORE in the L< K_ANY|../call/iup_k_any.html> callback.

The mouse cursor position can be programmatically controlled using the
global attribute L<CURSORPOS|../attrib/iup_globals.html#cursorpos>.
