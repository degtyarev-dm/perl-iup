[% n.iupclipboard %]

[% h.desc %] 

Creates an element that allows access to the clipboard. Each clipboard
should be destroyed using L<IUP::Destroy|IUP::Destroy>, but
you can use only one for entire application because it does not store
any data inside. Or you can simply create and destroy everytime you
need to copy or paste.
